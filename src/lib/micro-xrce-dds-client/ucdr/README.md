*eProsima MicroCDR* is a *C* library implementing the *CDR* standard serialization methods.
This library is focused on embedded and resource-limited systems.

*MicroCDR* uses a static buffer, and allow to serialize and deserialize in both, big endianness and little endianness.

## Usage examples
This is a code example showing the serialization and deserialization of a string.
As *MicroCDR* uses a static buffer, that means the user has to provide a defined buffer and its size during the *ucdrBuffer* creation.

```c
    #include <ucdr/microcdr.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    #define BUFFER_LENGTH 256

    int main(int argc, char** args)
    {
        // Data buffer
        uint8_t buffer[BUFFER_LENGTH];

        // Structs for handle the buffer.
        ucdrBuffer writer;
        ucdrBuffer reader;

        // Initialize the MicroBuffers for working with an user-managed buffer.
        ucdr_init_buffer(&writer, buffer, BUFFER_LENGTH);
        ucdr_init_buffer(&reader, buffer, BUFFER_LENGTH);

        // Serialize data
        char input[16] = "Hello MicroCDR!"; //16 characters
        ucdr_serialize_array_char(&writer, input, 16);

        // Deserialize data
        char output[16];
        ucdr_deserialize_array_char(&reader, output, 16);

        printf("Input: %s\n", input);
        printf("Output: %s\n", output);

        return 0;
    }
```

## API functions

```c
void ucdr_init_buffer                       (ucdrBuffer* ub, uint8_t* data, size_t size);
void ucdr_init_buffer_origin                (ucdrBuffer* ub, uint8_t* data, size_t size, size_t origin);
void ucdr_init_buffer_origin_offset         (ucdrBuffer* ub, uint8_t* data, size_t size, size_t origin, size_t offset);
void ucdr_init_buffer_origin_offset_endian  (ucdrBuffer* ub, uint8_t* data, size_t size, size_t origin, size_t offset, ucdrEndianness endianness);
```
Initialize a `ucdrBuffer` structure, the main struct of *MicroCDR*.
- `ub`: the `ucdrBuffer` struct.
- `data`: the buffer that the `ucdrBuffer` will use.
- `size`: the size of the buffer that the `ucdrBuffer` will use.
- `origin`: the origin of the XCDR stream.
- `offset`: where the serialization/deserialization will start.
- `endianness`: the endianness of the XCDR stream.
Initially, the serialization/deserialization starts at the beginning of the buffer.

---

```c
void ucdr_copy_buffer (ucdrBuffer* ub_dest, const ucdrBuffer* ub_source);
```
Copy a `ucdrBuffer` structure data to another `ucdrBuffer` structure.
- `ub_dest`: the destination `ucdrBuffer` struct.
- `ub_source`: the origin initialized `ucdrBuffer` struct.

---

```c
void ucdr_set_on_full_buffer_callback (ucdrBuffer* ub, OnFullBuffer on_full_buffer, void* args);
```
Sets the `on_full_buffer` callback which will be called each time the buffer arises its end.
- `ub`: the `ucdrBuffer` struct.
- `on_full_buffer`: the callcack.
- `args`: the argument passes to the callback.

---

```c
void ucdr_reset_buffer       (ucdrBuffer* ub);
void ucdr_reset_buffer_offset(ucdrBuffer* ub, size_t offset);
```
Reset the `ucdrBuffer` as the same state that it was created.
- `ub`: the `ucdrBuffer` struct.
- `offset`: where the serialization/deserialization will start.
Initially, the serialization/deserialization starts at the beginning of the buffer.

---

```c
void ucdr_align_to (ucdrBuffer* ub, size_t size);
```
Align the ucdrBuffer to the size `size`.
After call this function, the serialization pointer will be moved only if the current `ucdrBuffer` was not alignment to the passed value.

- `ub`: the `ucdrBuffer` struct
- `size`: the target size alignment.

---

```c
size_t ucdr_alignment(size_t buffer_position, size_t data_size);
```
Returns the alignment necessary to serialize/deserialize a type with `data_size` size.

- `buffer_position`: the current serialization/deserialization position of the `ucdrBuffer`. (Typically  `ub->iterator - ub->init`).
- `data_size`: the bytes of the data that you are asking for.

---

```c
size_t ucdr_buffer_alignment(const ucdrBuffer* ub, size_t data_size);
```
Returns the alignment necessary to serialize/deserialize a type with `data_size` size into the `ucdrBuffer` given.

- `ub`: the `ucdrBuffer` struct to ask the alignment.
- `data_size`: the bytes of the data that you are asking for.
---

```c
void ucdr_advance_buffer(const ucdrBuffer* ub, size_t size);
```
Advances the XCDR stream `size` bytes without de/serialization involved.

- `ub`: the `ucdrBuffer` struct to ask the alignment.
- `size`: the bytes to advance.

- `ub`: the `ucdrBuffer` struct

---

```c
ucdrEndianness ucdr_buffer_endianness(const ucdrBuffer* ub);
```

### Serialization/deserialization functions
Adding to this, there is a big set of functions for deserialize and deserialize different kind of types:
- Basics: `bool`, `char`, `int8_t`, `uint8_t`,`int16_t`, `uint16_t`,`int32_t`, `uint32_t`,`int64_t`, `uint64_t`,`float`, `double`.
- Arrays: Any fixed size of basics types.
- Sequence: Similar to arrays, but the information about the size is serialized along with the data.
- String: Wrapper of char sequence, but easily to use.

### Endianness
*MicroCDR* supports little and big endianness.
The **machine endianness** can be set by the cmake variable: `CONFIG_BIG_ENDIANNESS`.
By default, if this varible is `OFF` which means that the machine endianness is little endianness.

The `ucdrBuffer` endianness can be set by the `endianness` parameter of the structure to `UCDR_BIG_ENDIANNESS` or `UCDR_LITTLE_ENDIANNESS`.
Also, there are a functions that allow to force an endianness independiently of the `ucdrBuffer` endianness in their serialization/deserialization.
These functions contains the name `endianness` in their signature.

### Error
All serialization/deserialization functions return a boolean indicating the result of their operations.
When a serialization/deserialization could not be possible (the type can not be serialized, or the capacity of the destination buffer is not enough),
an status error is setted into the `ucdrBuffer`.
If a `ucdrBuffer` has an error state, the next serialization/deserialization operations will not works and will return `false` in their execution.
A buffer marked with an error can be used, but any serialization/deserialization operation over it will not produce any effect.

If is kwown that an operation can fails over a `ucdrBuffer`, and its necessary to continue with the serialization/deserialization if it happens,
the `ucdrBuffer` state can be saved using the `ucdr_copy_buffer` function.
After the application of the wrong serialization/deserialization, only the `ucdrBuffer` that performed the operation will have a dirty state.

## Additional features
### Endianness
*MicroCDR* supports little and big endianness.
The configuration can be done by cmake with the cmake `__BIG_ENDIAN__` variable.
A `0` value implies that the serialization will performed into a little endian machine, and `1` into a big endian machine.

The default endianness serialization can be choosen by setting the `endianness` parameter of a `ucdrBuffer`  to `UCDR_BIG_ENDIANNESS` or `UCDR_LITTLE_ENDIANNESS`.
Also, there are a functions that allow to force an endianness in their serialization/deserialization.
These functions contains the name `endiannness` in their signature.

### Error
All serialization/deserialization functions return a boolean indicating the result of their operations.
When a serialization/deserialization could not be possible (the type can not be serialized, or the capacity of the destination buffer is not enough),
an status error is setted into the `ucdrBuffer`.
If a `ucdrBuffer` has an error state, the next serialization/deserialization operations will not works and will return `false` in their execution.
A buffer marked with an error can be used, but any serialization/deserialization operation over it will not produce any effect.

If is kwown that an operation can fails over a `ucdrBuffer`, and its necessary to continue with the serialization/deserialization if it happens,
the `ucdrBuffer` state can be saved using the `ucdr_copy_buffer` function.
After the application of the wrong serialization/deserialization, only the `ucdrBuffer` that performed the operation will have a dirty state.

### Full buffer callback
MicroCDR provides a callback that the user can set in order to control the behavior when the `ucdrBuffer` can not serialize/deserialize anymore because the buffer is full.
This allows to create a better management error and/or modify the buffer location of the `ucdrBuffer`.
The last possibility gives the user the capacity to use several small buffers for a big serialization (see the *fragmentation* example).
