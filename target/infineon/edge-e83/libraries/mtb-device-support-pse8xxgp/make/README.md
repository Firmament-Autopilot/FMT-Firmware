# PSOC™ Edge GNU make Build System

## Overview

This repo provides the build recipe make files and scripts for building and programming PSOC™ Edge applications. Builds can be run either through a command-line interface (CLI) or through a supported IDE such as Eclipse or VS Code.

## Prerequisite

Builds require that the ModusToolbox™ tools be installed on your machine. This comes with the ModusToolbox™ install. On Windows machines, it is recommended that CLI builds be executed using the Cygwin.bat located in ModusToolBox/tools_x.y/modus-shell install directory. This guarantees a consistent shell environment for your builds.

## Options

To list the build options, run the "help" target by typing "make help" in CLI. For a verbose documentation on a specific subject type "make help CY_HELP={variable/target}", where "variable" or "target" is one of the listed make variables or targets.
