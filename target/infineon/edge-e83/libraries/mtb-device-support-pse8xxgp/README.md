# ModusToolbox™ PSE8xxGP Device Support Library (DSL)

## Overview
The ModusToolbox™ Device Support Library provides all necessary device specific components to be used during software development for the PSOC™ Edge E8x2G, E8x3G, E8x5G, E8x6G family of devices with 6MB total RAM (5MB System SRAM + 1MB SRAM).

## Features
The package includes:
*  PSOC™ Edge MCU Peripheral Driver Library (PDL) - provides, device header files, start-up code, and peripheral drivers as a set of low-level APIs to configure, initialize, and use various supported peripheral drivers
* Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) - provides high-level API wrappers around lower-level device specific APIs(such as PSOC™ MCU PDL)
* Device Utilities (device-utils) - handles the pre-defined System Power Management (SysPm) callback implementations for peripherals which require special handling when the MCU enters or exits
DeepSleep
* make - provides build recipe make files and scripts for building and programming device applications

See the [Release Notes](./RELEASE.md) for release-specific information.
